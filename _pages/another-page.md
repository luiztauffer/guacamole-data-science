This is another page I created just for kicks.

It doesn't need to be a post

It can be whatever I want =)

Notice that I added a `permalink` to it, in order to keep always the same url and not get affected by the last date I updated the page.


<div class="notice--primary">
  <h4>Notice:</h4>
  <p>Adding an attention remark.</p>
</div>


I can put in some highlighted code:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight wl linenos %}def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.{% endhighlight %}
