I spent 7 years applying Data Science and Machine Learning to research in neuroscience and behaviour (during my MSc and PhD) and, although I studied many theoretical tools and applied them to so many distinct dataset types, I came to realize there was a gap between my academic practices and the "outside world" practices. Also that my skills were poorly documented.

So I decided to set up a website-portfolio for some of the techniques I'm interested in. 

All the content available here serve purely research and educational purposes.
