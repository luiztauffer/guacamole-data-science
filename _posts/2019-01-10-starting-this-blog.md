While pondering on my life at 32, close to the end of this phd thing, searching for jobs and questioning **what-the-heck-am-I-doing-now??**... I decided to start this blog. "Oh well", thought I, "I guess it could serve me a couple of purposes". Indeed, I managed list a few points of motivation to dedicate myself (a bit) to this activity now:

1. A portfolio for my data science projects
2. A possible recurrent future activity
3. An useful activity when in need to ~~procrastinate~~ focus on something else 
4. Practicing nonscientific writting and reaching out to the world


# 1. A portfolio

When I started looking for jobs and career opportunities related to Data Science, I realized that, when it comes to what I **know** and **can do**, I had much to say and little to show. On that matter, a friend once told me that "*talking is cheap*" and I guess she was right. Setting up an online portfolio then!


Besides, there are few better ways of reinforcing one's knowledge of a subject than explaining it to someone else.


# 2. A secondary activity

It seems that, for many people, blogging is a complementary professional activity. 



# 3. Useful knowledge

Blogging might help not only to establish the knowledge related to the portfolio Data Science projects, but also to encourage the learning of new tools such as web development.



# 4. Writting practice

Being a non-native English speaker, properly writing meaningful content is a perpetual, arduous process. Even worse for those who, like me, have stuck their feet deep into the mud puddle of [technical/scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_writing) writing, where precision and [parsimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) are highly appreciated, to the detriment of creativity, pedagogy and subjective expression. There are just too many things that are better said in non-scientific terms and writing a blog might be a good exercise for those.
